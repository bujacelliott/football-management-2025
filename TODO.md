# UFM Improvement Backlog

- **Replace placeholder leagues with real squads**: Add accurate kits, colors, and player rosters for Championship, League One, and League Two clubs.
- **Lower-tier fixtures**: Extend fixture generation/scheduling to cover all domestic leagues, not just the Premier League.
- **Promotion/relegation logic**: Refine multi-tier promotions and relegations (currently simple random selection for lower tiers) with proper standings-based movement.
- **Cup entrants**: Include lower divisions in FA/League Cup once squads/fixtures are in place; adjust rounds accordingly.
- **Asset updates**: Revisit backgrounds/kits/logos to match new clubs once rosters are finalized.
- **Intro loop fix**: Stop the intro sound effect from looping/repeating; ensure it plays once or can be skipped.
- **Non-match background**: Swap the out-of-match background to a new design to distinguish menus from match view.
- **Full rosters**: Populate every team (all leagues) with correct player lists and basic stats.
- **Youth academy**: Add a separate youth academy feature (UI + data) for scouting/promoting youth players.
